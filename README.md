## üèÅ Quickstart

### Generate Secret Key

Before you continue, you need to create `.env` file (you can duplicate `.env.example`) and
fill the `application secret key` with some random string. To generate a secret key, use
the following command:

```sh
openssl rand -base64 500 | tr -dc 'a-zA-Z0-9' | fold -w 32 | head -n 1
```

If you don't have openssl installed, you can also use [1password](https://1password.com/password-generator)
to generate a random secret.

### Up and running

```sh
pnpm install      # install the dependencies
pnpm dev          # serve with hot reload

pnpm build        # build for production
pnpm start        # launch generated build
```

This starts your app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

The database seed script creates a new user with some data you can use to get started:

- Email: `admin@example.com`
- Password: `passw0rd`

## üöÄ Deployment

[Read the guide](./DEPLOY.md) to learn how to deploy this project.

## üßëüèª‚Äçüíª Development

This project uses TypeScript for type checking, [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for linting which
is configured in `.eslintrc.js`, and [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for auto-formatting in
this project. It's recommended to get TypeScript set up for your editor and install an editor
plugin (like the [VSCode Prettier plugin](https://s.id/vscode-prettier)) to get auto-formatting
on saving and get a really great in-editor experience with type checking and auto-complete.
